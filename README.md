# 🧾 AI-Powered Insurance Claim Document Parser

This project is an AI-powered web app that automates the extraction of key information from scanned health insurance claim documents (PDFs). It uses **OCR**, **LLMs**, and a clean UI to streamline group health insurance claims processing.

> 📌 Built as part of an internship assignment for **PlanCover** to demonstrate real-world application of AI in insurance claim operations.

## 🔍 Problem: Slow and Manual Claims Processing for Group Health Insurance

In group health insurance (used by companies to insure their employees), when employees file claims, the process is:

- 🐢 **Manual and slow** — requiring multiple document uploads, back-and-forth communication  
- ⚠️ **Error-prone** — due to incorrect or missing documents  
- ⏳ **Time-consuming** for both HR teams and insurers  
- 😤 **Frustrating for employees** — especially during medical emergencies

This delays claims settlement, creates a poor customer experience, and puts pressure on both insurance operations and the employer’s HR team.

## 🤖 AI Solution: Intelligent Claims Document Parser & Validator using LLMs

This project proposes an **AI-based assistant** that helps insurers and HR teams process claims quickly and accurately.

### ✅ What the AI Tool Will Do:

- 📄 Parse medical bills, discharge summaries, and claim forms (PDFs, images, or scanned docs) using **OCR + LLM**
- 🧠 Extract key fields:  
   `Patient name, Hospital, Admission/Discharge dates, Diagnosis, Amount claimed, etc.`
- ✅ Check policy compliance:
   - Is the disease covered?
   - Was the hospital in-network?
   - Are room rent limits exceeded?
- 🔍 Validate completeness:
   - Have all required documents been submitted?
   - Are scanned documents readable?
   - Are amounts consistent across bills?
- 📋 Generate a **structured claim summary** for internal teams to quickly approve or flag for review
