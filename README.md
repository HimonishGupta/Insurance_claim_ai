# 🧾 AI-Powered Insurance Claim Document Parser

This project is an AI-powered web app that automates the extraction of key information from scanned health insurance claim documents (PDFs). It uses **OCR** (Tesseract), **PDF parsing**, and **Streamlit** to convert scanned documents into structured data fields like patient name, diagnosis, hospital, amount claimed, etc.

> 📌 Built as part of an internship assignment for PlanCover to demonstrate real-world application of AI in insurance claim processing.
